pam_resolve
===========

Tries to resolve the rhost field in the pam stack

Intended use is with pam_access, where the application does not resolve
the remote address.

Debug with pam_warn.

Sample usage 

auth required pam_warn.so # shows rhost numeric
auth required pam_resolve.so # tries to resolve the rhost field
auth required pam_warn.so # shows rhost name now
auth required pam_access.so # now works with hostnames
